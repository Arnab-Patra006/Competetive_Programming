## concept :
Given an array arr[] of size N, find the prefix sum of the array. A prefix sum array is another array prefixSum[] of the same size, such that the value of prefixSum[i] is arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[2] . . . arr[i].
```
Input: arr[] = {10, 20, 10, 5, 15}
Output: prefixSum[] = {10, 30, 40, 45, 60}
Explanation: While traversing the array, update the element by adding it with its previous element.
